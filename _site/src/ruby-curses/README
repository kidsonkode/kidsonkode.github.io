This is a bunch of examples that show how to use the NCurses library in Ruby.

I wrote these while following the tutorial for the C library:
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/pdf/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO.pdf

You'll need to install the ncurses gem (not use the system library) to run them
gem install ncurses

I may also look into the rbcurse gem later on
