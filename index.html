  <h1>New Class Starting Saturday: Sept 28, 2013</h1>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
    <p>Time: Saturdays at 2:00pm</p>
    <p>Duration: 10 - 11 weeks</p>
    <p>Location: Multnomah Library - <a href="https://multcolib.org/library-location/north-portland" target="_blank">North Portland Branch</a></p>
  </h2>
  <p>The kids will learn basic concepts of programming and how the computer works.  They'll build a tic-tac-toe game, draw simple animations and pictures.  </p>
  <p>
    We will use publicly available lessons which will allow the students to experiment on their own.  Khan Academy, Code Academy and CodeHS are some of the sites we will use.  We will also use some of our own lessons.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Committment to learn</strong> is the only fee for the class.  Parents must commit to bringing their children on time (which means 10 minutes before the class starts). Students must be interested in learning something they might know and focus their time in the class to the lesson.
